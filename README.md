# Advent of code 2018
This repository contains my solutions to the problems in [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/). All of the solutions are written in C in preparation to the [UiO](https://www.uio.no/english/) course [IN2140](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN2140/index-eng.html) that I will be taking this spring.

## How to run the code:
To compile the code, navigate to the folder for the code you want to compile in your terminal and write `make day<day number> ` this will compile the code. To run the code simply write `./day<daynumber>`
